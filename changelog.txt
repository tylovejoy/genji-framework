    - redid the hud/iwt addon so that the text changes depending on wich cp you are on
    - added splits (replaces trace toggle). they track time spend since last cp. Practice mode has a seperate split and timer now.
    - orb hithitboxes are now 0.7 higher. this means it checks fyour midle of your body instead of your feet. this makes it so collecting them feels more accurate.

    important notes for map updates:
    - orbs hitboxes are now 0.7 higher on the Y and detect your midle instead of your feet. double check your orbs.
